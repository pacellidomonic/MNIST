# MNIST
* Machine learning project using the MNIST dataset
* Using the SVC(Support Vector Machine) Algorithim I trained and tested the MNSIT number dataset to predict the type of number presented 0-9.
* The accuracy came out to 97%
* I have also added displays of the dataset as a subplot using Matplotlib so you can visualize the outcome of the prediction.

Extract the mnsit_data.zip folder then run the python code
